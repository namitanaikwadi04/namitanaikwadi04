Greetings! I'm Namita Naikwadi, a passionate software developer with a strong foundation in full-stack web development, cloud computing, and cybersecurity. With hands-on experience in building scalable and secure applications, I'm currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science at Syracuse University and actively seeking **full-time roles** in software development or security-focused engineering.

I specialize in developing high-performance web applications using technologies like **React, Node.js, .NET, MongoDB, SQL**, and **AWS**. Whether it's securing web APIs, optimizing system performance, or deploying cloud-native apps, I love solving real-world challenges with clean, efficient, and elegant code.

If you're looking for a developer who thrives on innovation, collaboration, and continuous learning—let’s connect and create impactful solutions together!

### 💡 What I Bring to the Table

- **Programming Mastery:** Python, JavaScript, C#, Java, SQL, C++, Kotlin  
- **Framework Expertise:** React, Node.js, ASP.NET Core, Express.js, Flutter  
- **Database Whisperer:** MongoDB, SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Firebase  
- **Cloud & DevOps:** AWS (EC2, S3, RDS), Google Cloud, Jenkins, GitHub  
- **Security Savvy:** OWASP Top 10, SSL/TLS, JWT, Checkmarx, Splunk, WireShark
