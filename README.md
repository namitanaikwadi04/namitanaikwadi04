A curious and passionate software developer in the making. Over the last 4 years, I have built scalable backend systems, full-stack applications, and AI-driven features across FinTech and healthcare. My work spans Java and Spring Boot microservices, React.js interfaces, and cloud-native architectures on AWS.

I have delivered systems that improve performance, reduce latency, and support high-traffic workloads by optimizing SQL queries, creating monitoring solutions that keep production environments stable. On the AI side, I have integrated LLM assistants, built RAG pipelines, and deployed real-time inference services for clinical workflows.

Beyond engineering, I am actively engaged in professional communities that support growth, leadership, and technical excellence. I have been part of Women in Science and Engineering (WiSE), the Society of Women Engineers (SWE), and Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC), contributing to events, mentoring, and collaborative initiatives.

I am always excited to connect with fellow engineers, innovators, and builders to explore ideas and collaborate on meaningful projects. Let’s create something impactful together!
